# Default Abbreviations Dictionary

# Some rules:
# 1. Comments amd blanks in the file are ignored
# 2. The words will be uppercased, like:
#    - http_package -> HTTPPackage (for http abbreviation)
#    - sql_generic_api -> SQLGenericAPI (for sql and api abbreviations)
# 3. The boundaries are \b or _, so with "eset" abbreviation, eset_pkg
#    will become ESETPkg, but preset_pkg will stay PresetPkg
# 4. Abbreviations separated by "=" considered to have a concrete outcome, so
#    wifi = Wifi will yield WiFiHelpers from wifi_helpers, and with
#    helpdesk = HD you can transform helpdesk_routines into HDRoutines, and
#    ex_data_base_utils = DB will yield DBPkg from ex_data_base_utils_pkg
